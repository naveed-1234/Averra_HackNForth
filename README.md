Children are exposed to unsafe and explicit content online.
Parents often have no real-time insight into harmful browsing behavior.
Existing tools are invasive or limited to predefined filters.

Detects when a child visits pre-listed harmful websites.
Instantly blocks the content and sends alerts to the parent dashboard.

2. Harmful Website Detection – Uses a predefined database to detect unsafe websites.
3. Blocking System – Displays a warning message instead of the harmful site.
4. Alert System – Notifies the parent in real-time through the dashboard.

Backend: PHP, MySQL
Website Detection: Database lookup using server-side verification
